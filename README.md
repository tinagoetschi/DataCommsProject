| Unit 1: Principles of Computer Science        | Unit 2 : Fundamentals of Computer Systems           | Tasks  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|A Computational thinking  Application of the thinking skills involved in analysing problems and processes, to identify solutions that can be developed into computer programs.|E How data is transmitted by computer systems E1 Transmitting data  • Protocols used to govern and control data transmission.|Your problem is to design and develop your own data  packet transmission protocol using OO principles |
|A1 Decomposition  • Identifying and describing problems and processes. • Breaking down problems and processes into distinct steps.  • Describing problems and processes as a set of structured steps. |• Communicating the key features of problems and processes to others • Use of packet data in transmitting data:  o contents of a data packet  o the role of components of a data packet o packet switching  E2 Error detection  • Methods used to detect errors in data transmission:  o checksum      |This is the first step in your design |
|A4 Algorithm design  • Describing a step-by-step strategy to solve a problem. |F2 Flow charts and system diagrams  • The use of flow charts and diagrams to represent data flow in and between computer systems.  • The use, application and interpretation of flow charts and diagrams to solve problems.    |Now put it all together into a coherent algorithm  &/ flowchart|
| D2 Object-orientated programming  • Write code using object orientated programming paradigms in terms of:  o structure: – classes – objects/instances o features: – encapsulation  – data hiding – reusability.  • Debug and write code written in Java| |Now write the code that implements your design|
